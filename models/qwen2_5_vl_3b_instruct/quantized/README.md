# Qwen2.5-VL-3B Quantized Artifacts (Index)

This directory is reserved for local, non-committed quantized/exported model
artifacts (for example, deployable checkpoints or runtime-specific exports).

Per-layer sensitivity analysis outputs live under `../layer-analysis/` and are
intended to be committed; only `.pt` artifacts are ignored.
