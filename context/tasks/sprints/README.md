# Sprints

This directory contains short-term sprint documents that track focused batches of work.

Typical usage:
- Group a set of closely related tasks under a single sprint (e.g., “AutoQuant FP8 Qwen2.5-VL accuracy comparison”).
- Capture goals, subtasks, and quick status for a small time window or a specific experimental thread.

Sprints are meant to be:
- Lightweight and easy to scan.
- Cross-linked with longer-lived plans under `context/plans/` and detailed working tasks under `context/tasks/working/`.

Current examples:
- `sprint-autoquant-fp8-qwen2_5-vl-accuracy-comparison.md` — tracks the work around comparing FP8 AutoQuant schemes for Qwen2.5-VL-3B to the FP16/BF16 baseline using small COCO2017-derived evaluation sets and metrics like perplexity and logit KL.
